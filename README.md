Python Program Challenge
These are the steps to download and execute the program.

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Suppose to use Visual Studio, you can just click to open the .sln file to open the solution.
3. In Visual studio just click Ctrl + F5 to execute.
4. The console app will show, with the options.
5. Start with make a new seat plan clicking N option -- prompt how many rows and columns do you want.
6. Buy ticket option B -- reserve the seat and prompt for the user to put his name and age, and with row and column he wants.
7. Check available seat, show the map where 0 are available and 1 is unavailable.
8. You can save this plan, load other plan saved and make a new seat plan.
9. When you have inputs you can check all the customers and his information and the seats he bought.

It's a very simple console app, I planning to do something more but some issues and unpredictable things happen. But I believe I solved the problem,
with mapping an index and set up the seats available to 0 or 1 I could be put true or false as a Boolean value, but I believe, it's working.
Thank you 
Have a great day.
